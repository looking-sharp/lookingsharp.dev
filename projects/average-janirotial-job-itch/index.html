                    <p>
                        So you accepted the job eh? Good on you. Glad to see someone is willing to try and clean up this strange place. 
                        The job is pretty easy, just go into each house and remove the clutter. You can use your brand new VacPack model 13 
                        to clean up the houses with unparalleled efficiency. Oh, and be sure to keep any eye out for any... anomalous objects. 
                        We can't let any of those get out of hand.

                    <h2>About the game</h2>
                    <p>
                        This game was developed over the span of 2 weeks to be shown at an event hosted by the OSU game club.
                        We were invited to showcase games at one of the events, and I wanted to create something new. I came up
                        with the idea for a sort of magical heist simulator where the entire world could be manipulated and absorbed, and the objects
                        would have unique properties, including the ability to duplicate itself after some amount of time.
                        Eventually the game changed when I modeled the VacPack, and it shifted to a sort of magical cleaning / heist
                        simulator where you go into people's homes and absorb everything in their house. The duplicating logic works on
                        a clever system of determing how many duplicating objects are around the player, and setting the "time to duplicate"
                        based on that number, which can also be changed in the pause menu in the game.
                    </p>
