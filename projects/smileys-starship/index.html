                    <h2>About the game</h2>
                    <p>
                        This was my first ever game that I created. There were a lot of strange design choices and mechanic choices I 
                        made simply because I didn't know how to do it any better. As an example, Smiley's behavior is a simple linear interpolation
                        from where he is to a point. When he reaches the point, it shifts to the next position in a defined sequence and then loops.
                        It is a very simple game mechanic but it worked well for what the game was. This was also a fairly big project to take on as my 
                        first game, and rewuired me to learn a lot of skills, a lot of which I still use now, however the process of learning and the 
                        learning curve made this project take about a year and a half of work. It's not perfect, theres no real tutorial or explination of
                        mechanics, it's just a small experience and I'm fairly happy about how it turned out (for the most part)
                    </p>
