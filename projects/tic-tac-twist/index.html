                    <p>
                        Welcome to Tic-Tac-Twist! This is a Tic-Tac-Toe remix on a rubik's cube! You need two players to play this game
                        and you can run two instances on the same computer, or play across the world. Each turn, you place an 'X' or 'O'
                        on a face on the Rubik's cube, then twist a face. The game ends when someone gets 3 in a row on any face, and the game
                        can end in a tie. Enjoy the stratagy and fun of Tic-Tac-Twist.

                    <h2>About the game</h2>
                    <p>
                        This game is my first ever attempt at doing a multiplayer game. It was quite a challenge learning about Client and Server
                        RCP's, and how the communication works. I will say he most complicated part of this experience was creating the choose a 
                        symbol (x or o) UI work seamlessly between both the host and client. If someone chooses a symbol, the other player will 
                        automatically see that the symbol has been chosen, and that they cannot chose it themselves, unless the other player changes
                        it. This project came with many challenging aspects, but in the end, it's sleek and simplistic design and charm made it all
                        worth it. I'm really quite proud of this project, so I hope you enjoy it.
                    </p>
